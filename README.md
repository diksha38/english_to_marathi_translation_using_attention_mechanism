# This code implements a machine translation system to translate English sentences into Marathi using a sequence-to-sequence model with attention in TensorFlow. Here's a concise description:

1. Import and Load Data: Necessary libraries are imported, and the English-Marathi sentence pairs are loaded from a file into a DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning: Sentences are lowercased, punctuation and digits are removed, and Marathi sentences are marked with 'start' and 'end' tokens.

3. Tokenization: Sentences are converted into sequences of integers using tokenizers. Vocabularies and maximum sentence lengths are determined.

4. Padding and Splitting: Sequences are padded to uniform lengths and split into training and testing sets.

5. Dataset Preparation: A TensorFlow dataset is created, shuffled, and batched for training.

6. Attention Mechanism: `LuongAttention` class is defined to compute attention scores and generate context vectors.

7. Encoder and Decoder: The `Encoder` class encodes input sequences into hidden states using an LSTM. The `Decoder` class, which includes the attention mechanism, generates the output sequence word-by-word.

8. Training Functions: Loss and accuracy functions are defined, along with a `train_step` function to perform a single training step.

9. Training Loop: The `main_train` function runs the training loop, iterating through the dataset and saving checkpoints.

10. Prediction Function: `predict_seq2seq_att` function generates translations for input sentences using the trained encoder and decoder.

11. Example Usage: An example sentence is translated using the prediction function to demonstrate the model's output.
